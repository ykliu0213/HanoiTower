# HanoiTower
Tower of Hanoi implementation using stack.  
(Stack Data Structure)

## What is Tower of Hanoi
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.

### Rule and Objective
> The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:  
> 1. Only one disk can be moved at a time. 
> 2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
> 3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

### Solution
The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n âˆ’ 1, where n is the number of disks.
